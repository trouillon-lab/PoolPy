# Now I want to update the readme for my project. This was the old read me:

# Pooling

## Installation

`conda env create --name pooling_env --file=environment.yml`

## In progress

```python
assign_wells_multidim(n_compounds:int, n_dims:int)
```

Here, should we give an indication to the user on how to choose n_dims ? Maybe we could have already a default value which depends on n_compounds ?

```python
assign_wells_random(n_compounds:int, n_compounds_per_well:int, n_wells:int, guesses:int, differentiate:int)
```

Same question here for the additional parameters. Also differentiate is given a default value (1) in other functions, so I'd do the same here ?

My idea with this is that if we get default values for the method-specific parameters, then we can easily run a comparison function that gives the (default) results of all methods at once just based on n_compounds and differentiate as a general easy overview.
Placeholder for this: method_comparison

I have now updated the project management to go thorugh uv. I have run the commands you have suggested and created the necessary files. Can you write a nice readme, including the instructions on how to install uv, use uv to create the environment, manage the requrements that I spcified? It would be amazing if you could have it also somehow subdivided into mac/windows (maybe also linux?). Anyway, thanks!

Here‚Äôs a modernized, **uv-based README** for your project, with clear, platform-specific instructions for installation and environment management. This guide assumes you‚Äôve already run `uv init` and have committed the necessary project files.

# Pooling

A Python package for multidimensional and random well assignment strategies in pooling experiments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. **Install uv**

**uv** is a fast, modern Python environment and package manager.
Choose your platform and run the corresponding command:


| Platform | Command |
| :-- | :-- |
| **macOS/Linux** | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` |
| **Windows** | `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"` |

- For other installation methods (e.g., pip, pipx, Homebrew), see the [uv documentation][^1][^2][^3].


### 2. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pooling
```


### 3. **Set Up the Environment**

#### **All Platforms**

```bash
uv sync
```

- This will:
    - Create a `.venv` virtual environment (if not present)
    - Install the correct Python version (if specified in `.python-version`)
    - Install all dependencies as locked in `uv.lock` and listed in `pyproject.toml`[^4][^5][^6].


#### **(Optional) Activate the Environment**

| Platform | Command |
| :-- | :-- |
| macOS/Linux | `source .venv/bin/activate` |
| Windows | `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` |

> **Note:** Activating the environment is optional for most uv commands, but necessary if you want to use Python or pip directly[^4][^7][^3].

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Example Functions

```python
assign_wells_multidim(n_compounds: int, n_dims: int = None)
```

- *Tip: Consider providing a default for `n_dims` based on `n_compounds` for user convenience.*

```python
assign_wells_random(
    n_compounds: int,
    n_compounds_per_well: int,
    n_wells: int,
    guesses: int,
    differentiate: int = 1
)
```

- *Tip: `differentiate` defaults to 1 in other functions‚Äîconsider using the same default here.*


### Method Comparison

A future `method_comparison` function could provide an easy overview of all methods, using sensible defaults for method-specific parameters.

## üì¶ Managing Dependencies

- **Add a new dependency:**

```bash
uv add <package-name>
```

- **Add development dependencies:**

```bash
uv add --dev <package-name>
```

- **Import from requirements.txt:**

```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

- **Export current environment:**

```bash
uv export > requirements.txt
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Notes

- **uv** supports **macOS, Linux, and Windows** natively[^2].
- The `.venv` directory is created in your project root and should **not** be committed to git.
- All environment and dependency management is handled via `uv`‚Äîno need for `conda` or `pip` directly.


## üìö References

- [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [uv project structure and management][^5][^8]

**Replace `<your-repo-url>` with your actual repository URL.**

This README provides a clear, modern workflow for contributors on all major platforms, using uv as the sole environment and dependency manager. It eliminates the need for `conda`, and ensures reproducibility and ease of use for all collaborators[^9][^1][^4][^10][^6][^11][^2][^7][^5][^3][^8].
